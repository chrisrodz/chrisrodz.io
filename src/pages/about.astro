      <h2>Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹</h2>

      <p>
        I'm a software engineer passionate about building things that matter. By day, I write code
        and solve problems. By early morning and evening, I train for triathlons. And in between,
        I'm a dad trying to keep up with my kids.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Do</h3>

      <p>
        I specialize in building web applications with modern technologies. I love working with
        TypeScript, React, and all things JavaScript/Node.js. I'm particularly interested in
        developer experience, performance, and creating tools that make developers' lives easier.
      </p>

      <h3>Triathlon Journey</h3>

      <p>
        Swimming, biking, and running have become more than just hobbiesâ€”they're how I think through
        problems, push my limits, and stay balanced. I track my training here and share what I learn
        along the way.
      </p>

      <h3>Coffee & Code</h3>

      <p>
        There's something meditative about the coffee brewing process. From selecting beans to
        dialing in the perfect espresso shot, it's another form of problem-solving that I enjoy.
        I log my experiments in the <a href="/coffee">coffee section</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>This Blog</h3>

      <p>
        I write about software engineering, lessons learned from training, and whatever else seems
        worth sharing. The posts are a mix of technical deep-dives, training reflections, and
        occasional life updates.
      </p>
