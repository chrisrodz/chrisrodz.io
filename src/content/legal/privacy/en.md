## Overview

DobleSeis ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices for the DobleSeis mobile application.

## Data Collection

**DobleSeis does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.**

All game data (scores, game history, settings) is stored locally on your device using your device's secure storage. This data never leaves your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

## Information Stored Locally

The following information is stored only on your device:

- **Game Scores**: Current and historical game scores
- **Game History**: Record of completed games
- **App Settings**: User preferences such as target score and haptic feedback settings

This data is stored using your device's standard local storage mechanisms:

- iOS: NSUserDefaults and file storage
- Android: SharedPreferences and file storage

## Data Access

- We do not have access to any data stored by DobleSeis
- No analytics or tracking tools are implemented in the app
- No user accounts or authentication are required
- No network connections are made by the app (except to load app updates from the App Store/Play Store)

## Third-Party Services

DobleSeis does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Permissions

DobleSeis does not request any device permissions beyond those required for basic app functionality provided by React Native.

Current required permissions:

- **Internet Access** (Android only): Required by the React Native framework for app updates and debugging features. DobleSeis does not actively use this permission to transmit data.

## Children's Privacy

DobleSeis is suitable for all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, there are no special provisions required for children's privacy under COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all app data
- You can clear game history within the app using the "Clear All History" button in Settings
- You can reset the current game using the "Reset Game" button in Settings

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of DobleSeis after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data under laws such as GDPR (Europe) or CCPA (California). Since DobleSeis does not collect any personal data, these rights are not applicable to our app.

## Data Security

All data stored by DobleSeis uses your device's secure storage mechanisms:

- iOS: Data is protected by iOS sandbox and encryption
- Android: Data is protected by Android's per-app storage isolation

## International Data Transfers

Since DobleSeis does not collect or transmit any data, there are no international data transfers.

---

**Summary:** DobleSeis is a privacy-first app. We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal information. All your game data stays on your device.
