If you made it this far and don't know me, pleasure to meet you. I'm Christian Rodríguez, from Bayamón, Puerto Rico. I'm a software engineer, amateur triathlete, and recently became dad to the most beautiful little girl in the world.

I'm not sure if it has to do with being a new father, or if it's the emergence of all these AI tools, but I've gotten this fresh inspiration to create stuff and write code for personal projects. The first thing that came to mind is that I should have my own website. I mean, I've owned my own [domain](https://chrisrodz.io) for several years now, though I was only using it for my [email](mailto:hey@chrisrodz.io). Getting the website up and running seemed like an excellent testing ground for whatever personal project type ideas I come up with. Plus it serves as home for this blog, where I'll be sharing my adventure building with AI.

The plan is to build, and write about what I learn along the way. For now the website has my [Coffee Diary](https://chrisrodz.io/en/cafe), a tool I made to better track my daily coffee brewing. I get different beans every month from [Cuela](https://cuela.coffee/), and when I get repeat beans I have to find that perfect configuration all over again. With this tool I can capture that data for my personal use, and create something that fits into my daily routine.

Next up, I'll be writing more about the process of creating this website and the coffee diary, the things AI helped me with and the things I had to do draw on my professional experience for. Subscribe to my [RSS feed](https://chrisrodz.io/rss.xml) if you'd like to keep up with that content. God bless and see you next time buddy.
