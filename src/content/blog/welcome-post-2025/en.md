If you've made it here and we haven't met, it's a pleasure to see you here. I'm Christian Rodríguez, from Bayamón, Puerto Rico. I'm a software engineer, amateur triathlete, and recent dad of the most beautiful girl in the world.

Not sure if it has to do with becoming a father, or the advent of AI coding tools, that have given me fresh inspiration to create stuff, to deploy code to production for myself. Thinking about some basic things that folks in my industry have I thought I should definitely have my own website. I mean, I've owned my own domain for a few years now. I've only been using it for my [e-mail](mailto:hey@chrisrodz.io). Shipping my personal website seems like the perfect testing ground for any new ideas I have in the short-term.

But, what can I put on my website **today**? I'm a bit shy to have a website that's just a landing page with my face on it. What occurs to me right now is just my words. In the middle of a bunch of text (and code) written by my AI coding helper, I think it's a cool idea to have my own words written (typed) by me with sweat and tears.

Thus, I created a new Github repo and chrisrodz.io was breathed into life. The plan is to add a few personal features I'm interested in and have somewhere to deploy them. The other plan is to write some content in this blog. I've been reflecting a lot on the digital footprint we leave behind. I want to leave a stronger footprint that is more my own, so that Alina can discover it when she grows up.

This is the part where I invite you to subscribe to my RSS feed or buy me a coffee, but I haven't had time to set any of that up. God bless and see you next time friend.
