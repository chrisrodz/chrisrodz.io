# Welcome!

This is my new personal website built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Here you'll find:

## Coffee Tracking 🔔

I'm an avid coffee enthusiast and track all my brewing experiments. You can see my coffee log to follow along with my journey of discovering great beans and perfecting brewing techniques.

## Training Log 🏃‍♂️

As a triathlete, I track my swimming, cycling, and running activities. The training section syncs with Strava to show my recent workouts and progress.

## Blog 📝

I'll be writing about software engineering, triathlon training, and life as a dad. Stay tuned for more content!

## Tech Stack

This site is built with:
- **Astro** for the framework
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** and **Pico CSS** for styling
- **Supabase** for the database
- **Vercel** for hosting

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to explore!
