Execute the Tailwind to PicoCSS migration by following the plan in TAILWIND_TO_PICO_MIGRATION_PLAN.md. Read START_MIGRATION.md for your full autonomous execution instructions. Work through each phase systematically, test every change with Chrome DevTools MCP (screenshots, dark mode, mobile, console errors), commit after each file, and iterate until complete. Start by reading START_MIGRATION.md and the migration plan, check git status to determine where to begin (prerequisites if fresh, or resume based on last commit), then execute autonomously. Use TodoWrite to track progress. Ask for help only if stuck after 3 retry attempts or if the plan is unclear. Your goal: migrate all 11 files, pass all Success Criteria, zero Tailwind classes remaining.
